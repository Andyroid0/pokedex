# Pokedex

### If I were to expand on this:

- I would break this down into screens, then code split with lazy loading and suspense components.
- Break components down into organized subdirectories.
- Route screens with expo router.

**NOTE:** I did spend a bit of time on the UI. As I am a fan and was enjoying myself. ðŸ™‚
